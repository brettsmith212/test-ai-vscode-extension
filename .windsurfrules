# Claude Chat (VSCode Extension)

This is a VSCode extension for chatting with Claude-3.5.

It is organized into two main sections

1. src/

The src/ directory contains the main extension code.
It contains the logic for the extension and connecting to the claude llm model. We will also build out the agentic abilities here.

2. webviews/

The webviews/ directory is used to store the webview code, which is used to display the chat interface in the webview. The code here is written in React typescript.

When making changes to this repository, make as few changes as required to complete the request. Try to minimize installing dependencies to only those required.

The UI should have a minimalistic design based around dark themes.
Use Shadcn ui components and TailwindCSS for the UI. When installing shadcn ui components put them in the webviews/components/ui/ directory.
Make buttons and icons modern and easy to use.
